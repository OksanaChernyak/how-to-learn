# Yandex Practicum "How to Learn" project

In this project I'm trying to demonstrate what I've leart in a month of a deep dive :diving_mask: into *HTML and CSS*.

The main difference between first and second sprint is BEM structure of files. Also we learned some animation tricks.

Used HTML and CSS for this project.
